# HelloOpenCV
`HelloOpenCV` is a small BlackBerry 10 app that includes the OpenCV computer vision library.

This should get you up and running quickly.

Get the sources from the BlackBerry 10 port of OpenCV [here](https://github.com/blackberry/OpenCV) and the binary builds of this library [here](http://www.greenviolet.net/~lewellyn/OpenCV-QNX.zip) (warning: zip-file).

I used [this post from Sean](http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Cascades-Development/OpenCV-sample-project-and-troubles/td-p/2146603/highlight/true/page/2) in the BlackBerry Support Forums as a reference.
